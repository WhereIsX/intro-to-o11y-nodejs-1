Intro to Observability: Demo in Node.js
================

This Node.js application is here for you to try out tracing.
It consists of a microservice that calls itself,
so you can simulate a whole microservice ecosystem with just one service!

## What to do

Remix this app in Glitch so that you can edit it.

On the home page, click "Go" to see a sequence of numbers appear gradually.
Maybe open the browser tools and notice how long each request takes.
Why does it get slower and slower?

Let's add tracing and find out!
